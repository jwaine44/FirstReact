            const domContainer = document.querySelector('#root');
            // Then we created a root with ReactDOM.createRoot. It's a simple function that defines the entry point into our DOM. This is where and what React is allowed to interact with.
            const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(domContainer);
            // Finally we rendered some content with root.render. Using React.createElement, we're saying we want a new h1 tag that contains a string of text. The empty curly braces {} we don't need to worry about right now, but that's for passing props and events. After the React scripts load, our browser executes the script that will call the method root.render. This method will overwrite what we originally had in the div with id root with an h1 that contains "Our First React page has rendered". 
            root.render(React.createElement("h1", {}, "Our First React page has rendered"));
